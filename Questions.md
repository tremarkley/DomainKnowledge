A triple is a tuple of three items. The difference between a tuple and a set is that a set is a collection of objects that is unordered and does not allow for duplicates.

### What is the average and worst-case time complexity of access, search, and insertion for common data structures? For each answer, briefly explain why.
| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insertion
|---|---|---|---|
Array | O(1) | O(n) | O(n)
Queue | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)
Stack | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)
Singly-linked list | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)
Hash table | O(1) | O(1) | O(1)
BST | O(log(n)) | O(log(n)) | O(log(n))
